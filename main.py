"""main.py — the wire. FastAPI, two routes, kept deliberately apart.

    POST /capture   multipart/form-data. STT or OCR, nothing else.
        Either one "audio" file (+ optional "language_code")
            -> {"transcript": str, "transcript_en": str|absent}
        or one-or-more "documents" files
            -> {"scanned_documents": [{"name", "chars", "text"}, ...]}

    POST /speak     application/json. {"finding": id, "language_code": str}
        -> the question translated into the patient's language, spoken by
        bulbul-v3, PLUS the translated text so it can be shown on screen and
        checked. Refuses clinician-only questions.

    POST /analyze   application/json. extract -> propose -> triage, over
        everything accumulated so far.
            {"transcript": str, "doc_text": str,
             "confirmed_exclusions": [str], "asked": [str]}
            -> the panel payload (see engine.assess)

    GET  /web/...   the single-file frontend.

KEEP THESE TWO SEPARATE. They look mergeable and are not. When the frontend
used one combined endpoint, every recording and every upload ran a full
extraction whose result was immediately thrown away, then ran a second one
from the panel refresh — double the Sarvam cost and double the latency on
every single action. That merged route (/assess) has been deleted rather
than left available, because leaving it available is how it comes back.

WHY /analyze RE-SENDS THE WHOLE TRANSCRIPT EVERY TIME. Evidence arrives in
pieces: a recording, then a document, then another recording, minutes apart.
Extraction re-runs across the FULL accumulation every time, never
incrementally over the new chunk. A later statement can correct an earlier
one ("no, it's the right calf, not the left") and only a model seeing both
can resolve that; merging per-chunk findings would keep both as true. This
costs a full call per update, and the disk cache in llm.py absorbs the
repeats.

TWO THINGS SURVIVE ACROSS UPDATES, and the client sends them back on every
call: confirmed_exclusions (once a clinician ticks "PE ruled out by CTPA",
that holds for the rest of the consult) and asked (findings already put to
the patient, so the panel never re-asks). Candidates, ordering and the next
question all recompute fresh.

THERE IS NO OFFLINE REPLAY MODE AND NO PRE-COMPUTED PAYLOAD. --offline
replayed demo/offline_response.json and GET /contract.json served a
pre-computed engine result; both are gone. They are how a "live" demo kept
showing canned output that had nothing to do with the person in the room.
Everything on screen comes from this patient, this session, or the panel
says plainly that it has nothing.

Usage:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py            # http://127.0.0.1:8000/web/
    python main.py --port 8080

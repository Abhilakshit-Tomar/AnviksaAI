"""selftest.py — the invariants. Offline, no data files, no API calls, seconds.

    python selftest.py

There is no dataset here, no calibration, no eval, and no measured accuracy.
Nothing in this project can tell you it got a diagnosis right. What this file
can tell you is that the rules the product is built on still hold — that the
panel cannot re-ask an answered question, cannot silently remove a warning,
cannot print a number, and cannot invent findings out of an empty
consultation.

Those are the rules in CLAUDE.md under "Non-negotiable". Every one of them is
non-negotiable because breaking it produced a real bug, a real fabrication, or
a real piece of false precision at some point in this project's history. This
file is what keeps them from coming back quietly.

WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT TEST: whether the candidates are any
good. That needs a clinician scoring real consultations, and until that
happens no amount of green output here means the panel is useful. Do not read
a pass as a safety claim.

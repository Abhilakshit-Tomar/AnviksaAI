"""engine.py — triage. No model call, no network, no randomness, no arithmetic
anyone could mistake for a measurement.

    from engine import Engine
    eng = Engine.load()
    out = eng.assess(candidates, findings, confirmed_exclusions=["Pulmonary embolism"])

propose.py says what conditions are worth keeping in mind. This decides how
they are shown: which band of harm-if-missed they fall into, how well the
findings actually support them, which are still open, and what single
question would most divide the list. It runs offline in milliseconds.

WHAT WAS DELETED FROM THIS FILE, AND WHY IT MUST NOT COME BACK

`posterior()`, `tau`, `abstain_entropy`, `_entropy`, `ranked_risk()` and the
information-gain block are gone, along with numpy. They implemented naive
Bayes over 49 synthetic pathologies from a dataset that has been dropped.

Naive Bayes scored each condition by multiplying findings independently, so
nothing anywhere could represent findings that only mean something TOGETHER.
Pericarditis demonstrated it concretely: "worse lying flat, better leaning
forward" plus "recent viral illness" is a classic trio, but scored separately
the viral-illness term dragged toward the dozen commoner respiratory
illnesses in the set and pericarditis never surfaced. No rephrasing of the
input fixed it, because the architecture had nowhere to put the joint
meaning. That is an argument about structure, not about tuning, which is why
the replacement is a model that reads findings together and a file that rates
harm — not a better prior.

THE THREE RULES THIS FILE ENFORCES

1. NO NUMBER EVER REACHES THE SCREEN. Not a percentage, not a score, not a
   confidence. Severity numbers exist in severity.yaml because a file needs
   sortable values; they are converted to words here and the payload carries
   only words. Nobody is ever certain in medicine, and three significant
   figures imply a precision no input to this system can support.

2. SEVERITY AND SUPPORT ARE TWO AXES AND ARE NEVER MULTIPLIED. `P x severity`
   was meaningful when P was a real probability. Without one, a single
   blended number is a fabrication that throws away the two things the
   clinician actually wants held apart: how bad would this be to miss, and
   how well does it actually fit this patient.

3. EXCLUSION PROPOSES; IT NEVER AUTO-REMOVES. Recording a CTPA makes the
   panel ASK whether to mark pulmonary embolism ruled out. It does not
   silently drop it. Every other error in this system adds noise to a list a
   human is already reading. An exclusion error REMOVES A WARNING, and nobody
   ever sees what they were not shown. It is the only failure mode here
   shaped like patient harm, so a human makes every removal.

        THIS IS A SAFETY MECHANISM, NOT A CONVENIENCE. The candidate list is
        unbounded by design — propose.py is given no list to choose from — so
        conditions arrive named however the model chose to name them. Matching
        on exact strings meant "Panic attack (acute anxiety episode)" scored as
        unrated when severity.yaml plainly rates "Panic attack", which was
        observed on the canonical case the first time this ran end to end.

        Harmless there. Not harmless in the other direction: "Acute pulmonary
        embolism" failing to match "Pulmonary embolism" would drop a critical
        condition out of Can't-Miss entirely, losing its exclusion rule with
        it, over a spelling. That is a warning removed by a string comparison,
        which is precisely what this system is not allowed to do.

        So matching is deliberately generous, and generous in the safe
        direction. Over-matching puts something on the panel a clinician can
        dismiss in a second. Under-matching hides it. Where several entries
        match, the most severe wins, for the same reason.

        What it does NOT do is guess. Nothing here maps an unfamiliar condition
        onto a familiar-looking one — matching requires the rulebook entry's
        own words to be present in the candidate's name. A genuinely unlisted
        condition still comes back unrated and is shown as such, because the

        Nobody can have the best question. This picks a useful one and says so.

        The rule, in one sentence: ask about the finding that bears on the most
        dangerous still-open candidate; where several do, take the one that
        candidate itself ranked as most decisive; break what remains toward the
        finding fewer candidates are waiting on, since a question everything

        displayed figure that pretends to be a measurement. Choosing which
